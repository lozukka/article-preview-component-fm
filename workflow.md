My project management plan for this challenge:

- get to know the challenge
- setup the files
  - make style.css and script.js and download fonts
  - make sure linked files work
- write the basic HTML structure
- style the mobile view
- make the logic work
  - if necessary: fix HTML and CSS
- style desktop view
- final fixes

- And submit the solution!

Things I should look up:

- the correct way to adjusts font size (accessibility ways)
  -> I can use variables. I can name the variables by px.:

```
:root{
--13px: 0.813rem;
--16px: 1rem;
}
```

Where I left:

- doing the share-section positioning.
