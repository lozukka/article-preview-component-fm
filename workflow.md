My project management plan for this challenge:

- get to know the challenge
- setup the files
  - make style.css and script.js and download fonts
  - make sure linked files work
- write the basic HTML structure
- style the mobile view
- make the logic work
  - if necessary: fix HTML and CSS
- style desktop view
- final fixes

- And submit the solution!

Things I should look up:
