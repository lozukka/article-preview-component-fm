## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I tried with this project to write a workflow-file. Just so that the future me know, where we started.

I used same logic with this than with a mobile nav would. I think it works kind of ok. I notised that the dark background element, that is in the desktop is not coming with the starter files. (I felt lazy and didn't do one on my own.)

### Continued development

I have to learn more about CSS animations. I think that the right animation can elevate this project.

Maybe some hover-effect could also look nice.
